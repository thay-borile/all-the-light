What readers are saying

It has been a while since I have found a book that I wanted to read slowly so that I could soak in every detail in hopes that the last page seems to never come.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough! It has quickly become one of my absolute favorite books. It's truly captivating and well-written. Doerr writes with absolutely beautiful imagery.

All the Light We Cannot See is like no other book that I've read before. It provides a unique insight into how others think, and feel, and live, and love.

In just a few words, the author is able draw the reader into the world of the characters to experience it for ourselves. I enjoyed the book immensely!
